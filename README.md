# Pixel Snapper
A Color Picker for Windows that allows you to retrieve the color for any pixel on your screen. This project was originally developed back in 2017 and released on the [Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/pixel-snapper/9P1HL9C3M21W).

If you are interested in this type of tool on Windows, you are better off using something like [Microsoft PowerToys](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/)
